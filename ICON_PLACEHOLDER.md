# Extension Icon

This directory should contain an icon.png file for the extension. For now, you can:

1. Create a 128x128 PNG image representing MinangScript (maybe with mountain elements representing Minangkabau)
2. Save it as `icon.png` in the root directory of the extension

The icon should represent:
- Minangkabau culture (mountains, traditional patterns)
- Programming/code elements
- Modern technology

Suggested colors:
- Gold/Yellow (traditional Minangkabau colors)
- Green (representing nature)
- Blue (representing technology)
